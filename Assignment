If you are meeting together T and/or Th, here is your assignment:

Look over each others codes to solve for the source location and strength with two sensors.  
How could the code be improved in terms of comments or formatting the print statement?  
Feel free to look at my example for ideas.  
If you have questions about the equations, using modules, calling modules, etc, ask one another.  
I think between the three of you, you guys have all the answers!  (
We have come a long way in just a couple of weeks, I am really proud of you!).

If you finish that or are working alone:

Program the code for three sensors (on the board in Ms. Unal's classroom or ask Ethan).

Using turtle design a simple city (two intersecting streets with grass in the fields).

If you do all that and are still looking for a challenge add the following to your city:

Houses
Vehicles (Cars, Trucks, Buses)
Using the random function, plot a source with a random strength at a random location.
